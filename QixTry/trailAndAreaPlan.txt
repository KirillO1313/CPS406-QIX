1. In setup():
   - Create trails Group with appropriate properties
   - Set trailSegmentDistance = 10 // Distance between trail segments
   
2. Create new player state tracking:
   - Create isPlayerOnBorder() function that returns a boolean:
     * Checks all borders and returns true if player is on any border
     * Returns false otherwise
     * Include tolerance parameter for border proximity detection
   - trailStartPoint = null
   - currentTrail = [] (to store current trail segments)
   - lastTrailSegmentPos = null // Track last position where we created a segment
   - previousBorderStatus = isPlayerOnBorder() // Initial state
   - lastBorderTouched = null
   
3. Modify player update logic:
   - In player update or movement function:
     * Get currentBorderStatus = isPlayerOnBorder()
     * Check for status change:
       
     * If previousBorderStatus === true && currentBorderStatus === false:
       // Player just moved off a border
       - Record trailStartPoint = player's position
       - Record lastBorderTouched = current border
       - Initialize lastTrailSegmentPos = player's position
       - Begin trail creation mode

     * If previousBorderStatus === false && currentBorderStatus === true:
       // Player just returned to a border
       - Identify which border was touched
       - Attempt to close area with attemptAreaClosure()
       - Convert trail to borders with convertTrailsToBorders()
       
     * Update previousBorderStatus = currentBorderStatus
   
4. In draw() or player update:
   - If !isPlayerOnBorder():
     * Calculate distance from lastTrailSegmentPos to current position
     * If distance >= trailSegmentDistance:
       - Create new trail segment
       - Update lastTrailSegmentPos = player's position
       - For visual continuity, draw a line between last segment and current one
   
5. New function: isPlayerOnBorder(tolerance = 5)
   - For each border in Borders:
     * Check if player is on this border using existing isOnBorder() helper
     * If true, store this border as lastBorderTouched and return true
   - Return false if no border match found
   
6. New function: createTrailSegment()
   - Create new sprite in trails Group
   - Position at player position
   - Set diameter smaller than player
   - Set visual properties (color, etc.)
   - Add to currentTrail array
   
7. New function: attemptAreaClosure()
   - Check if trail forms a valid loop (starts and ends on borders)
   - Calculate enclosed area:
     * Use point-in-polygon method to find grid points inside new area
     * Calculate percentage of total field area
   - Update claimedArea percentage
   - Update score based on area claimed
   
8. New function: convertTrailsToBorders()
   - Create new border sprites for trail segments but optimize:
     * Analyze trail path to identify straight segments
     * Create fewer, longer border sprites for straight sections
     * For corners/curves, use individual border segments
   - Connect new borders to existing border network
   - Remove all trail segments after conversion
   
9. Enhanced collision detection:
   - Add collision detection between:
     * qixi and trails (player dies)
     * sparx and trails (player dies)
     * player and their own trail (check only when player changes direction)
   
10. New function: calculateClaimedArea()
    - Create a grid representation of the game field
    - Mark all points inside the new enclosed area using flood fill
      * Start flood fill from a point inside the area (can be found by casting ray from trail midpoint)
      * Only fill points inside game field and not already claimed
    - Count filled grid points and calculate percentage of total
    - For optimization, use a coarse grid for calculation
   
11. New function: visualizeAreaClaim()
    - Create visual effect to show newly claimed area 
    - Animation can be simple color transition
    - Apply to the filled points from calculateClaimedArea()
